# Justforfun
I'm taking a fundamentals of programming class before I do my data science masters and just made this for the fun of it with the help of ChatGPT. I was working on a different version the recognizes writing, but I was running into too many issues. This is a great MVP to start though. Way more fun than I thought.
It works the best with black writing, single digit, and white background, althought I haven't experimented too much with other layouts.
The numbers were just generated from DALLE using the prompt "a simple, nothing flashy, number ___ in handwritten text, black ink, white background"
I think that's it.
